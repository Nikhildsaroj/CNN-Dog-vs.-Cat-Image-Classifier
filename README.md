# CNN Dog vs. Cat Image Classifier

### Description:
This repository hosts a project that classifies images of dogs and cats using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Leveraging the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset, comprising over 25,000 images, the project employs Python code and TensorFlow/Keras libraries for robust model development and training.

### Key Details:
### **Platform to Use:** Google Colab 
- **Dataset:** The Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset features an extensive array of dog and cat images, meticulously categorized into train, validation, and test subsets. These subsets serve as the cornerstone for training, validating, and evaluating the CNN model.
- **Model:** Employing the VGG16 model architecture, a renowned deep convolutional neural network crafted by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford, our project harnesses 16 layers, encompassing both convolutional and fully connected layers.

- **Training:** Our CNN model undergoes rigorous training using the training and validation subsets. Through meticulous parameter optimization and early stopping mechanisms, we ensure that our model learns to minimize classification loss over multiple epochs, while steering clear of the treacherous waters of overfitting.

- **Evaluation:** To gauge the prowess of our trained CNN model, we subject it to the ultimate litmus testâ€”the test subset of the dataset. Armed with metrics such as accuracy, we meticulously assess its ability to discern between images of dogs and cats.
